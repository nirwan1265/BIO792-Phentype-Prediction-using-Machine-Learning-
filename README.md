# Introduction
This github page is intended to serve as a repository for a Machine Learning Project for the course requirement for BIO 792. 

## About the data
We are using the Sorghum accessions from the Lasky Panel (Lasky et.al, 2017) for our analysis. We have filtered the data to represent the African region to reduce population structure, environmental variables, and other confounding factors. The accessions have been skimmed sequenced and has a total of ~400,000 SNPs. 

## Data availability
All the data for the project is available in the following google drive:

## Plan of Action
1.) Feature Selection

2.) Phenotype Prediction using Machine Learning
